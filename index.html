        My Name is Emily Jonaitis. I am a very driven person. I love skateboarding and I feel like skateboarding in a
        lot of ways is like coding. If you don't know how to do something, you go to other sources on tips and tricks
        on how to do that certain thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then you practice and practice and continue to try until you get the overall answer or result that you want.
        You might take a few falls here and there and thats good! It all comes with learning something new.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end once you land that trick or have the result that you were striving towards. You have a sense of
        accomplishment like no other. Which feels amazing and just makes you want to learn more.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have certainly enjoyed making this website!
